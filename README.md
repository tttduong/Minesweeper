*APPLYING GUILDANCE*
Step 1: Clone the "main" branch to your machine in step one.
Step 2: Open "src," choose the main class, and then execute.

*NOTE* 
In this case, I'm using IntelliJ (Community) with JDK 20 and a few third-party libraries. Thus, please make use of IntelliJi and JKD 20 to ensure that everything runs smoothly. Please do these steps if you are unable to run the program:
Step 1: Select "Project Structure" from the menu bar by going to "File."
Step 2: Select Dependencies and Modules from the Project Settings.
Step 3: Please update the Module SDK to SDK 20 if your error is related to the SDK version.
Step 4: Next, select Apply and click OK. 
Step 5: Rerun the main.
